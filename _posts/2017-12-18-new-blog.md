After two years of development, we decided to keep you up a little better about what we do. Therefore, today, we introduce our new blog, which will be used to announce releases, changes, and keep you up with all the cool stuff we work on.

Since we started this blog only recently, we haven't decided on how to use it, and whether we consider publishing third-party posts. Therefore, feel free to contact us with ideas and/or texts. See [this page]({{ site.baseurl}}/press/contact/) for information how to get in touch with us.

Special thanks goes to [Tobias Groza](https://github.com/TobiGr), who has set up the blog system and put a lot of effort in the design.
