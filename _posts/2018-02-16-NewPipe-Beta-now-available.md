With the aim of making NewPipe bug free and achieving a stable 1.0.0 release,
we are proud to announce the immediate availability of NewPipe Beta.

<!-- more -->

The beta is provided as a separate app and can be downloaded and installed via [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/packages/org.schabi.newpipe.beta/).
It includes not only new features such as local playlist and SoundCloud support. Furthermore, it comes with an interface to detect memory leaks.

From now on, Team NewPipe try to ensure to only introduce new stable features to the normal application.
