In December, the annual [Chaos Communication Congress](https://events.ccc.de/2017/08/09/34c3-presale/) will take place. This is the 34th time hackers from all around the world meet and attend the largest hacker convention in Europe.

Like last year Christian Schabesberger, the initial author and primary maintainer of NewPipe will talk about the development progress of this year, and the roadmap of the next year.
This time, we hope that there will be a camera so that a video of the talk can be shot.

So, if you happen to attend the 34C3 event, please visit the talk during the first conference day, [December 27, 2017, 2 pm, Saal 3](https://events.ccc.de/congress/2017/wiki/index.php/Session:Newpipe).

Feel free to leave some ideas for the talk in the comments!
