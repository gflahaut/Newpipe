Team NewPipe needs your help!

Since we do not collect any data in the app or on the website,
we depend on your feedback.

Therefore, please take two minutes to tell us what you like about NewPipe,
which features you use most and what could be improved.
Your participation allows us to collect the information we need to improve NewPipe.
So please leave a comment below and help us advance NewPipe.

Not only the app, but also our website is constantly being developed further.
Part of our new web presence will also be an area where very nice feedback is presented
to convince potential new users of NewPipe. So if you like a feature of the app, please share it.

With this in mind, we would like to thank everyone who gives us feedback regularly on GitHub.
