title: "Does NewPipe use the YouTube API?"
---
<section>
    <p>No. NewPipe does not rely on the YouTube API, as using it requires an API key bringing with it specific regulations and restrictions. YouTube would then have more options of <a href="https://developers.google.com/youtube/terms/api-services-terms-of-service#api-clients-and-monitoring">tracking your YouTube usage at their disposal</a>.
        Therefore, <a href="https://github.com/TeamNewPipe/NewPipeExtractor/">NewPipe Extractor</a> gets the information by parsing YouTube websites.</p>
