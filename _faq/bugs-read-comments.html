title: "Read YouTube Comments"

<section>
    <p>Team NewPipe have reached several requests to view and create comments of YouTube videos.</p>
    <p>Since NewPipe's goal is to protect its users privacy, this feature is implemented partly.
        A Google login is required to write comments and therefore this part will not be available.<br/>
        However viewing top-level comments is possible now. It is planned to add support for comment replies later.
