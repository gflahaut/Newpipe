title: "Enable background player on Huawei devices"
---

<section>
    <p>Several media player apps like VLC and NewPipe have problems with background players on devices with
        Huawei's EMUI 8 interface.
        These problems are caused by a new battery saving policy which blocks particular background services.
        To make NewPipe work properly, you need to except it from the battery optimization.
